# DirtRider Fullstack 

An in development personal project that fills the gap in the market for hiring dirt bikes from individual people. 

## In Progress 
I am currently learning how to implement this with Azure AD and SQL so I am able to deploy on Azure cloud. Keep checking in to see the progress! 


### User Story as Customer

### User Story as Bike Host

## Current setup

### Frontend set-up
